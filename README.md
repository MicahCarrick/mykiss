This project is a work in progress...

like 5 years in the making ...

started in C/GTK+ 2 ...

then ported to Python/GTK+ 2 ...

then updated to GTK+ 3 ...

in other words this is my "fun" project and I hope, maybe, someday there will be 
a real release. But no promises.


Dependencies
------------

* Python 2 (sad face... let's make this work with 2 and 3)
* pyxdg
* Yapsy 1.9 (for Python 2) pip install yapsy==1.9
